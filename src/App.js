// have a state for each form as complete or not which displays either an input or a finished form (how to do with new ___ button?)
  //when you hit edit, it will bring up every field already filled in (if there is an object in array, then populate if not everything is blank)

// Be sure to include an edit and submit button for each section or for the whole CV, your preference. 
// The submit button should submit your form and display the value of your input fields in HTML elements. 
// The edit button should add back (display) the input fields, 
//   with the previously displayed information as values. In those input fields, 
//     you should be able to edit and resubmit the content. 
//     Youâ€™re going to make heavy use of state and props, so make sure you understood those concepts.
